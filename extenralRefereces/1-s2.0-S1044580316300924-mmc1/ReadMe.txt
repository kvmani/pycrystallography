The matlab codes are found in 'EBSD_Tutorial_Demo.m' and work well within MATLAB Version: 8.5.0.197613 (R2015a). 
Output from the matlab code can be found within '\Published_Matlab\EBSD_Tutorial_Demo.html' as a published demonstration of the code.

The python codes 'plotEBSDLatticeGeo.py' and running information can be found within 'Python_README.TXT'

A complete description of conventions used within these codes can be found in the technical document called 'BRUKER-ebsd-crystalgeometry.pdf'
