Pycrystallography (Python Crystallography) is a open-source Python library
for materials analysis with a focus on making crystallographic clacualtions easy for practicing 
materials scientists, esp in the feild of phase transformations. Following are the main intended
features of the project.

1. Fully object orieanted classes for majority of the common operations like finding angle, 
   distance etc. crystallographic directions planes.
   Structure objects.
2. Extensive visualization support to make understaqnd the crystal orieantion etc easy.
3. Powerful analysis tools, including generation of diffraction patterns, kikuchi lines etc which
   are used in orientation analysis of crystals (for e.g. in TEM and EBSD)

Pycrystallography is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this
library by making your own contributions.  These contributions can be in the
form of additional tools or modules you develop, or feature requests and bug
reports. 


1. **It is targetted to be well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation is being 
   written to help you get to grips with it quickly.
2. **It is open.** You are free to use and contribute to Pycrystallography. It also means
   that Pycrystallography is continuously being improved. 
 

It is targetted from the beginning to support both Python 2.7 as well
as Python 3.x. 

Getting Pycrystallography
================

Before installing Pycrystallography, you may need to first install a few critical
dependencies manually. Please refer to the official `Pycrystallography page`_ for
installation details and requirements, including instructions for the
bleeding edge developmental version. 

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable
release that is relatively bug-free. The easiest way to install Pycrystallography on
any system is to use pip::

    pip install Pycrystallography


Change Log
==========

This is the very first version.

Using Pycrystallography
==============

Please refer to the official `Pycrystallography page`_ for tutorials and examples.

About the Pycrystallography Development Team
===================================

K V Mani Krishna is the project lead.
It is not clear if any other will join this project at the moment.


Our Copyright Policy
====================

Pycrystallography uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Pycrystallography. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the
Pycrystallography source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any
single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire Pycrystallography Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a
record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when
they commit the change to one of the Pycrystallography repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms::
