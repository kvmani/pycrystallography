# Repository Guidelines

- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running examples.
- To verify the setup, run `python examples/angleBetweenDirections.py` from the `examples` directory.
  This script should complete without errors and prints an angle table.
- Include any output or test result snippets when summarizing changes.

## Development tips
- Prefer an object-oriented approach for new utilities where practical.
- Provide minimal sample data and automated tests for each new script.
